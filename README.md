# Documentation
This git contains the input and output data applied in the paper "title of the paper".
You can find three folders:
* "Code" contains the code of the implemented solution approaches, especially the heuristics.
* "Input" contains the instances applied to test the different algorithms. The data is based on the paper Vallada et al. (2015) New hard benchmark for flowshop scheduling problems minimising makespan. You can find the original instances and some documentation about them.
* "Output" contains the detailed results. In "Evaluations" you can find all tables analyzing the results of the MILP and heuristics. Furthermore, the folder "Results_CPLEX" and the file "Results_heuristics" contain all generated data used for the evaluation.

If you have any questions, we are happy to get in touch with you. Please contact us via "mail adress".
